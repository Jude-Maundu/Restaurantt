                    Leafy green surroundings, a cool breeze, great food and a relaxed ambience makes About Thyme stand out as one of the rare restaurants that allows you to immerse yourself in the best experience of al fresco dining within the city in a lush, sunken, multi-level garden setting with secret nooks and hidden crannies. In the evenings, fairy lights, candles and charcoal braziers set the tone for a warm and romantic atmosphere with a cozy indoor dining option complete with a wood-burning fireplace for the colder months.
